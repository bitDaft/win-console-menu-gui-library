# win-console-menu-gui-library
This is a library which is used for easily creating user friendly menu for windows console..

# Update:
 - ### Consider this library deprecated. Use at own risk!
 - ### I will be updating this library in coming 1 or 2 months to be usable. Track this project to get updates when the library is updated.
 - ### This was created long ago when i was getting into windows programming.
 - The current code is very messy, unreadable, and unmaintainable.
 - may contain bugs.
 - no documentation is there.
